# First-Unity-Game
This is my first attempt at creating a game in Unity
While all of the coding styles and practices in the C# scripts are mine, the majority of the 
code was written by following a tutorial on LinkedIn Learning 

### However, I did add some additions of my own: 
- added a difficulty multiplier so that the obstacles spawn more frequently as time goes on
- added a quit button
    
### User Guide: 
- simply press any key or button to start/restart the game and make the player jump to avoid obstacles 

### Future: 
- as I said, this was made by following a tutorial since I had 0 Unity experience prior to this project 
- I am looking to create another 2-D platformer on my own in the future
